    "In this project, we are interested in understanding if we can predict when a fuel compliance test will fail. \n",
    "\n",
    "The state of Tennessee's Department of Agriculture (TDA) maintaines a fuel quality inspection program. Each year, the state inspects all places where fuel is sold/ distributed including gas stations, terminals and airports. The results of these routine tests as well as follow up tests for complaints are maintained by the Tennessee Department of Agriculture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Although around 97% of the tests pass these compliance tests, each year around 3% of the tests fail. A failing test could mean that consumers are exposed to fuel that could do harm to their property or themselves. "

    "***The following key metrics were descriptions given to us by the TDA Fuel Quality Manager. The main thing that we were inspecting in this project was the prediction of pass/fail rates and volatility properties with the seasons.*** \n",
    "\n",
    "Volatility is an important property of gasoline because it must be able to vaporize before combusting in an engine. Three characteristics are used to measure the volatility of gasoline and evaluate suitability: vapor pressure, vapor-liquid ratio, and the distillation temperature at which 50% of the fuel is evaporated.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vapor pressure is a measure of the amount of vapor that is produced by a gasoline sample at 37.8°C (100°F). Vapor pressure most affects an engine’s ease of starting. The vapor pressure specification is a maximum allowable limit reported in kilopascals. The pressure must be high enough to promote easy starting but not too high to contribute to excessive emissions or vapor lock -  the presence of too much vapor that leads to loss of engine power or rough operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Vapor-liquid ratio is the ratio of the volume of vapor to the volume of liquid at atmospheric pressure. The vapor-liquid ratio specification is a minimum allowable limit reported in degrees Celsius. The reported value is the temperature at which the vapor-liquid ratio is equal to 20 (20:1 vol/vol), the approximate temperature at which engine problems may occur. Vapor-liquid ratio is used to evaluate a gasoline sample’s tolerance to changes in temperature. A noncompliant test result (too low) may lead to vapor lock or hot fuel handling problems, as evidenced by loss of power while accelerating or idling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Distillation measures the temperature range across which a sample is heated to fully evaporate. The temperature at which 50% of a sample is evaporated (T50) relates to the driveability (smoothness and ease of driving) and idling characteristics for the fuel. T50 most similarly relates to how a fuel performs under continuous activity (not starting or warming up). T50 has minimum and maximum allowable limits reported in degrees Celsius."
